# Calibrating-an-Event-based-Structured-Light-System

This project presents a formation optimization method based on finite-state machine and decentralized MPC. By attributing different cost items into state machine, the agent can perform certain intelligent behavior like obstacle avoidance, predator avoidance and younger protection. These behaviors are demonstrated by numerical simulation, where the effect of time horizon, agent number are analyzed. Our work provides a solution for optimizing the best path for the multi-agent system with different weights in the presence of hazards and obstacles.

Due to the confidentiality of the code we only show some part of the report here. If you are interested in more detail, feel free to contact me email: qimaqi@ethz.ch
